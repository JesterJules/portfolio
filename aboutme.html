        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        Last year I successfully completed a BA (Hons) in Film production. At university, I acquired good communication skills and learned to work effectively as a team member alongside fellow filmmakers to create several short films. I have developed leadership skills when tasked with directing films and while captaining a fencing team for several years. I can easily adapt to various roles and working environments. Having completed university my next goal is to have the opportunity to start an exciting and challenging career in something I enjoy.

            Within Film Production, I was trained in many aspects of filmmaking. I gained a good understanding of set etiquette as well as set up and wrap equipment. In addition to this, I directed multiple short films which solidified my leadership skills and helped create a strong appreciation of filmmaking from pre to post production. I am especially proud of having the film I directed, “Alpha Mail” screened at HOME cinema in Manchester for their short film Showcase.
